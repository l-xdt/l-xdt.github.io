## FAQ

**Now for the official last time, my favourite part FAQ!**

#### Can I modify this to fit my needs?

Yeah, sure! That is why we make repositories like these public, for you to tinker and try new things while learning.

#### Can I host this? If I can how?

You can! With my favourite Apache Container, XAMPP. since this is the last (official) repository here is a quick summary:

So, Apache uses 127.0.0.1 which leads back every Windows and Linux, (and some configured macOS) machines, back to itself to host websites, and XAMPP gives it a GUI (Graphical Interface)

Here is a [download](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) to it. And if you are struggling with it here is a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no) (by MainlyWebStuff); and for the novices here is a tutorial on how to self-host a domain: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs) (by Soeng Souy).

## Documentation

- This project doesn't really have any good documentation, just a normal understanding of HTML and CSS to understand, (knowing JavaScript is optional, but would be a upperhand).

- But here is the website I took this from, [solo.to](https://solo.to), the website itself.


## API Reference

There are no APIs known of, this project only consists of Vanilla HTML, CSS, Javascript, and images. No frameworks, if there is, I will update this readMe.
